Course project DUNE-GAME

Umm, this is a try to create my first big OOP/c++ project.
The task for this project is:
"Develop a blank computer games such as Dune. 
Time and space are discrete. There are several races. All of them are mutually hostile. 
The field in which there is a struggle, consists of the cells of. 
Each cell can be sand, spice field or mountain. 
Spice box is characterized by spice and speed of its stay. 
Gore is not available for ground vehicles. 
Each race has at its disposal a database and machine. 
Each machine has the armor, the current position and velocity of movement. 
Machines are divided into transport and combat. 
Transport vehicles are able to collect spice (in the period they are terrestrial) and 
transport it to the base (at the moment they air). 
Combat vehicles have weapons against ground targets, its rate of fire, 
range and weapons at air targets, its rate of fire, range. 
Combat vehicles are divided into aerial and ground. 
Air machines can move any cells, including the mountains, but they can not be large armor. 
At ground combat vehicles, located on the spice box, reduced armor. 
The base can build new war machines. Type the new machine is selected randomly. 
Transport the machine, it can be built only in the event that the fighting in this race, 
killing all machines of this type. 
In addition, some races have extra features - Recover armor land combat vehicles, 
slowing the reduction of armor on the spice box, restoration of armor from the available spice. 
The game continues as long as there will be the only race that has the machine.
In the simulation can be viewed object parameters:
-> Each race - a list of machines and their status
-> The average amount collected per transport spice machine.
-> The average lifetime of cars at the races without additional features compared to the average lifetime of the machine races with additional capabilities.
-> Each race - the number of types of machines destroyed other races.
-> It is desirable to display the process of the game using a graphical interface.
